98.7  -  FLOAT
$15.99  - TEXT

2. Explain when a database would be used. Explain when a text file would be used.

When we need to store information in a system and several inputs/outputs can be done in short amount of time, it can be hard to 
keep track of all changes without a database. A database also keeps the data if the program is shut down. So, if you are running a program 
that needs to store data putside of the program and the data needs to be accessible by multiple applications at the same time, use a database. 

However, if there is only one instance of the application that needs access to the data we can use a text file instead and it's not 
necessary to use a database. 

3. Describe one difference between SQL and other programming languages.

SQL is a declarative programming language and not procedural as many other languages. 

4. In your own words, explain how the pieces of a database system fit together at a high level.
I am not sure wxactly to what pieces the question is referring to, so below is my take on it :) 

A database a storage system where data can be stored and accessed. It consists of tables that follows a specific schema that declares 
the columns and data types for each table. Tables in a database can be related to each other and they will then have foreign keys as a column
that is referring to a primary key in another table. This allows us to store data separate and minimize redundancy, but still keep the ability 
to link data together. 


5. Explain the meaning of table, row, column, and value.

The data in a database are stored in tables, and each table has both row(s) and column(s). A column is defining what type of data 
that will be stored and a row represents one entity in the database. A value is what actually is stored in one specific place. 

6. List three data types that can be used in a table.

Integer, Text and Float. 

7. Given this payments table, provide an English description of the following queries and include their results:

     SELECT date, amount
     FROM payments;

Select data from the date and amount column from the table called payments. 

Results: 
5/1/2016, 1500.00
5/10/2016, 37.00
5/15/2016, 124.93
5/23/2016, 54.72

     SELECT amount
     FROM payments
     WHERE amount > 500;

Select data from the amount column, from the payments table, where the amount is higher than 500

Results:
1500.00


     SELECT *
     FROM payments
     WHERE payee = 'Mega Foods';

Select all the data from the payment table where the payee's name is equal to Mega Food

Results: 
5/15/2016, Mega Food, 124.93, Groceries


8. Given this users table, write SQL queries using the following criteria and include the output:

* The email and sign-up date for the user named DeAndre Data.

SELECT email, signup FROM users where name = 'DeAndre Data'
Results: 
datad@comcats.net, 2008-01-20

* The user ID for the user with email 'aleesia.algorithm@uw.edu'.

SELECT userid from users where email = 'aleesia.algorithm@uw.edu'
Results: 
1

* All the columns for the user ID equal to 4.

SELECT * from users where userid = 4
Results: 
4, Brandy Boolean, bboolean@nasa.gov, 1999-10-15
