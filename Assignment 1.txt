2. Explain when a database would be used. Explain when a text file would be used.

When we need to store information in a system and several inputs/outputs can be done in short amount of time, it can be hard to 
keep track of all changes without a database. A database also keeps the data if the program is shut down. So, if you are running a program 
that needs to store data putside of the program and the data needs to be accessible by multiple applications at the same time, use a database. 

However, if there is only one instance of the application that needs access to the data we can use a text file instead and it's not 
necessary to use a database. 

3. Describe one difference between SQL and other programming languages.

SQL is a declarative programming language and not procedural as many other languages. 

4. In your own words, explain how the pieces of a database system fit together at a high level.



5. Explain the meaning of table, row, column, and value.

The data in a database are stored in tables, and each table has both row(s) and column(s). A column is defining what type of data 
that will be stored and a row represents one entity in the database. A value is what actually is stored in one specific place. 

6. List three data types that can be used in a table.

Integer, String and Float.
